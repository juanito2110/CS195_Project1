Brief description of your game:
This is just a classic sudoku game, i did it because all the sudoku games the UIs are bright and pretty basic and i tried to do something a bit different. There is different difficulty modes, as well as hint button clear, solve and check buttons. Also like other sudoku games it highlights the 3x3 grid of the cell you have selected and if you make a mistake it highlights the numbers that are making conflict and the other cells with the same number, i can still polish a bit more this feature but i ran out of time so is not as good as i would've like it to be i bet if you try a bit you will find some of the small bugs that i have still but i will definetly polish before adding it to my portfolio.

What "new thing" you learned and how to use it
I learned how a sudoku game works, i had rarely played it and also all the error handling and small details that this games have that when you play you don't really realize or value and is nice to learn that.

Any challenges you faced
Mostly css features because first with the grid i struggled a little bit and later with the error handling there was a lot of different classes i had to write and polish to make them work. So if you look at the code is really messy because i ran out of time and had to submit it. I used AI to add some comments and make it quick but the css specially is very messy and the javascript a bit too. 

AI Usage Documentation: List any AI tools used (ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, etc.), what you used them for, and cite specific instances
AI Reflection: 2-3 sentences on what worked well with AI assistance and what didn't
I have the vscode copilot extension that helps a lot with repetitive things like creating the grid and things like that and also chatGPT for debugging and help me with the errors i was getting and also giving me guidelines of how the structure should look and what functions would be good to have. But any time it tried to build a function it never worked and it broke everything so it was just useful to help me solve specific bugs in some functions. In general it helped me a lot to be able to code quicker because this app belive it or not had a lot of different buttons and things i had to get to work and make them work all together so getting some help for debugging definetly makes the process way quicker and less frustating.
